Assessments: 20%

Exam: 80%

### Aim：

1. More about basics of organising（组织）， accessing（访问）, managing data（数据管理） and the algorithms（算法） to manipulate them.

2. Touches upon foundations of designing and building programs.

3. Programs with collections of data 

   ​	• Different kinds of data 

   ​	• Different kinds of collections 

   ​	• Data structures for implementing collections 

   ​	• Algorithms for dealing with collections 

4. Programs with algorithms for access, control, i/o, etc.

5. Analysing programs, algorithms, and data structures (efficiency, correctness).

### Collections

#### Types: 

Set, List, Directory/Map, Bag, Stack, Queue, Grid, Hierarchy/Tree, Network........

#### Structures:

• No structure – just a collection of values 

• Linear structure of values – the order matters 

• Set of key-value pairs

 • Hierarchical structures • Grid/table

#### Access disciplines(访问规则)

• get, put, delete anywhere 

• get, put, delete only at the ends, or only at the top, or at both ends… 

• get, put, delete by position, or by value, or by key, or …

* 数据（collection）相当于原料，而算法（Algorithm）相当于步骤。

#### Algorithm VS Program

### Data Structure

Defination: A data structure is a systematic way of organising a collection of data for efficient access    

• Every data structure needs a variety of algorithms for processing the data in it



#### Abstraction？

• As a process, abstraction denotes the extracting of the essential details about an item, or a group of items, while ignoring the nonessential details.

(作为一个进程，抽象意味着提取他们的基本细节而并非忽略)

• As an entity, abstraction denotes a model, a view, or some representation for an actual item which leaves out some of the details of the item

（作为一个实体当中某一方面的表示，忽略了某些细节）

Abstraction dictates that some information is more important than other information, but does not provide a specific mechanism for handling the unimportant information.

----

In the context of software development, we can distinguish different kinds of abstractions:

* The aim of **data abstraction** is to identify which details of how data is stored and can be manipulated are important and which are not（决定那些细节存储和控制的是重要的，那些不是）
*  The aim of **procedural abstraction** is to identify which details of how a task is accomplished are important and which are not（识别那些过程的完成是重要的，那些不是。 ）

---

• Extracting the **commonality** of components and hiding their details.	(提取共性隐藏细节)

• Abstraction typically focuses on the **outside view** of an object/concept.	（关注于实物的外观Outside view）
