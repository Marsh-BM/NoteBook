* The aim is to build a system for scanning the standard UoL answers sheets for multiple choice questions when given as multipage PDFs. Each page would correspond to a single student and each question has 5 options to choose from and only one is correct. The correct answers to each question would be given as a text file and the software should mark each of the answer sheet and produce a CSV file (a text file with comma seperated values) with the scores for each student. A bunch of test cases (PDFs) would be provided to test your program on. You can use any programming language and libraries for image progessing, manipulating PDFs and CSVs in this project.
* 其目的是建立一个系统来扫描标准UoL的选择题答案表，当给出多页pdf时。每页对应一个学生，每个问题有5个选项可供选择，只有一个是正确的。每个问题的正确答案将作为文本文件给出，软件应该标记每个答题卡并生成一个CSV文件(用逗号分隔值的文本文件)，其中包含每个学生的分数。将提供一堆测试用例(pdf)来测试您的程序。您可以使用任何编程语言和库
